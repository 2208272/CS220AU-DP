# [Social Media and Fake news in the 2016 election US](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.31.2.211&fbclid=IwAR04My3aiycypMJKSI58e84gDvdrodsB9fqCycH9YfepWDDDwT--fZnVPvo;%20https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2019/january/fake-news-shared-by-very-few--but-those-over-65-more-likely-to-p.html)
* Following the 2016 US presidential election, many have expressed concern about the effects of false stories ("fake news"), circulated largely through social media. We discuss the economics of fake news and present new data on its consumption prior to the election. Drawing on web browsing data, archives of fact-checking websites, and results from a new online survey, we find: 1) social media was an important but not dominant source of election news, with 14 percent of Americans calling social media their "most important" source; 2) of the known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times; 3) the average American adult saw on the order of one or perhaps several fake news stories in the months around the election, with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them; and 4) people are much more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.


* Introduction

In the rapidly evolving digital era, the dissemination of information has reached unprecedented levels, with the advent of social media and online platforms. This surge, however, has not only brought about the democratization of information but has also given rise to a darker underbelly—fake news, propaganda, and misinformation. This paper delves into the profound impact of these digital phenomena on societies, exploring their potential to induce existential crises. As we navigate an era where information can be weaponized, understanding the consequences becomes paramount.

The significance of this study extends beyond theoretical concerns, finding practical relevance in recent geopolitical events. One such poignant example is the Russian war in Ukraine, where the use of fake news and propaganda played a pivotal role in shaping perceptions and influencing the course of the conflict. By scrutinizing this case, we aim to unravel the intricate ways in which misinformation can be employed as a tool of power, impacting not only individuals’ cognitive landscapes but also the very fabric of international relations.

As we embark on this exploration, it is essential to recognize the interconnectedness of the digital world and its real-world ramifications. The implications of fake news and misinformation are not confined to the realm of information but have the potential to disrupt the foundations of trust, democracy, and peace. By comprehending the multifaceted nature of these issues, we can better equip ourselves to address the challenges posed by the information age and safeguard the integrity of our global society.

* II. The Digital Landscape

A. Rapid Dissemination of Information Online

The digital landscape has ushered in an era where information travels at an unprecedented pace, shaping public discourse and perceptions. As noted by Zubiaga et al. (2016), the velocity of information dissemination on platforms like Twitter has increased substantially, contributing to the swift propagation of both accurate and misleading content. This speed, while facilitating the spread of knowledge, also amplifies the challenges of filtering misinformation.

B. Influence of Social Media Platforms

Research by Pennycook and Rand (2018) emphasizes the outsized role of social media platforms in amplifying the impact of misinformation. These platforms, designed to connect people and ideas, have inadvertently become conduits for the rapid spread of fake news. The algorithmic structures of platforms like Facebook and Twitter often prioritize engaging content over accuracy, inadvertently fostering an environment where misinformation can thrive.

C. Challenges in Discerning Reliable Information

The ease with which information is shared online poses significant challenges in discerning reliable sources. Vosoughi et al. (2018) found that false information spreads faster and reaches more people than the truth, primarily due to its novelty and emotional appeal. This phenomenon contributes to the creation of echo chambers, where individuals are exposed to information that aligns with their existing beliefs, further complicating efforts to separate fact from fiction.

As we navigate this digital terrain, it becomes evident that the characteristics of online communication inherently influence the dynamics of information flow, creating an environment where misinformation can proliferate with alarming speed and efficacy. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to formulating effective strategies to mitigate the impact of fake news and propaganda in the digital realm.

* III. Effects of Fake News and Misinformation

A. Cognitive Impact on Individuals

Research by Lewandowsky et al. (2012) highlights the cognitive repercussions of exposure to misinformation. Individuals exposed to false information may develop false memories, impacting their decision-making processes and overall cognitive frameworks. This phenomenon has profound implications for public opinion formation and the potential manipulation of beliefs through the strategic dissemination of misinformation.

B. Erosion of Trust in Institutions

Studies such as Edelman’s Trust Barometer (2020) emphasize the corrosive effect of misinformation on public trust. As misinformation spreads, trust in traditional institutions, including media, government, and academia, diminishes. The erosion of trust exacerbates societal divisions, hindering collective efforts to address pressing issues and undermining the foundations of a well-functioning democracy.

C. Polarization Within Societies

Van Bavel et al. (2018) delve into the role of misinformation in fostering social and political polarization. Misinformation often reinforces existing ideological divides, contributing to the formation of echo chambers and filter bubbles. This polarization not only impedes constructive dialogue but also heightens societal tensions, potentially leading to increased social unrest and instability.

As these studies underscore, the effects of fake news and misinformation extend beyond mere inaccuracies. They permeate the cognitive, social, and political dimensions of our societies, posing significant challenges to the fabric of informed public discourse. Understanding these effects is crucial for developing interventions and strategies aimed at mitigating the detrimental impact of misinformation on individuals and societies at large.

* IV. Case Study: Russian War in Ukraine**

A. *Overview of the Conflict*

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not only been fought on the battlefield but also in the digital domain. Studies such as Rid and Buchanan's analysis (2019) provide a comprehensive overview of the complex geopolitical factors at play, emphasizing the role of information warfare in shaping the narrative surrounding the conflict. This case study becomes a poignant illustration of the strategic use of fake news and propaganda.

B. *Examination of Russia's Use of Fake News and Propaganda*

Kramer and Starr's research (2019) delves into Russia's systematic employment of disinformation campaigns, revealing a sophisticated strategy aimed at sowing discord and shaping global perceptions. The Kremlin's use of state-sponsored media outlets and social media manipulation underscores the intentional weaponization of information to achieve strategic objectives, both domestically and internationally.

C. *Examples of Misinformation Campaigns*

Instances of misinformation abound in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine. The dissection of specific campaigns, as detailed in studies by Higgins (2016) and the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, reveals the deliberate spread of false narratives, ranging from fabricated events to manipulated images. These campaigns not only targeted domestic audiences but also sought to influence the international community's perception of the conflict.

By examining the nuances of Russia's information warfare tactics in the Ukrainian conflict, we gain valuable insights into the real-world implications of fake news and propaganda. This case study serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences when misinformation is wielded as a geopolitical tool, affecting not only the immediate parties involved but also the broader global community.

* V. The Role in Exacerbating Existential Crisis** 

A. *Impact on International Relations*

Research by Wardle and Derakhshan (2017) illuminates the role of misinformation in heightening tensions and straining international relations. The intentional spread of false narratives, as seen in various geopolitical conflicts, including the Russian war in Ukraine, can contribute to a breakdown in diplomatic channels. This not only exacerbates existing geopolitical challenges but also has the potential to escalate conflicts, ultimately posing a threat to global peace and stability.

B. *Destabilization of Democratic Processes*

The destabilizing influence of misinformation on democratic processes is underscored by studies such as Allcott and Gentzkow (2017). Misinformation campaigns, when strategically employed, can undermine the foundations of democratic societies by eroding trust in electoral systems and fostering skepticism about the legitimacy of democratic institutions. This erosion of confidence weakens the societal fabric, making it susceptible to manipulation and exacerbating existential crises within democracies.

C. *Long-Term Consequences for Affected Regions*

Empirical evidence, as presented in the work of Nyhan and Reifler (2010), highlights the enduring consequences of misinformation on affected regions. Beyond immediate conflicts, the perpetuation of false narratives can contribute to long-term instability, hindering post-conflict reconstruction and impeding the prospects of sustainable peace. The socio-political fallout from misinformation campaigns can linger, posing ongoing challenges for the affected populations and impeding efforts toward recovery and reconciliation.

As we confront the nexus between misinformation and existential crises, understanding the multifaceted impact on international relations, democratic processes, and the long-term stability of affected regions becomes imperative. This awareness forms the basis for devising strategic interventions to mitigate the far-reaching consequences of misinformation on a global scale.
