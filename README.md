## Peer-assessment 

This is a feedback I recived.

> "Generally, there is a very high level of attention paid to detail across all parts of this essay. All parts addressed are to a very good academic standard and there are many relevant and precise references to key related literature, and these are explored in great depth. Your analysis demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter and your ideas are also effectively articulated to the reader. Your use of evidence and research to support your arguments is particularly effective, and adds a further layer of depth as well as credibility to your response.
>
> Your ability to take comprehensive and organized notes is very evident in this piece, and allows for a well-structured essay to be written. Your website is also very well-designed and aesthetic to the eye. You could potentially add another image further down in the article (maybe between ‘Case Study: Russian War in Ukraine’ and ‘The Role in Exacerbating Existential Crisis‘) in order to break up the prose so it isn’t too overwhelming for the reader. Your time management skills are apparent in terms of maximising productivity, and have helped you to create a strong argument and assisting webpage.
>
> It may be beneficial to reference White and Le Cornu (2017) and add a couple of sentences of explanation about your VR map, and why it’s been included in your essay. (eg. creating direct links between propaganda and war, or  explaining in further detail the wider impact). This may provide more explicit connections between your ideas and subsequently lead to a more seamless narrative being created. But overall, you’ve written a very strong essay with lots of intricate depth, and have communicated your messages meaningfully."

## Self-assessment

> I think my work is complete with interesting sources—a lot of scientific evidence to back up points. The synthesis of these sources helps build a comprehensive understanding of the impact of fake news, propaganda, and misinformation on societies and geopolitical conflicts. The integration of real-world examples, such as the Russian war in Ukraine, further enhances the practical application of theoretical knowledge.
>
> The logic applied in presenting the content is strong. The essay has a clear structure, leading the reader through a well-defined narrative. Also, visually engaging elements were used to support the context of the text.
>
> While the language is generally straightforward, it might be useful to make the content more engaging. And maybe I need more practice to improve the flow between paragraphs by incorporating transition sentences. This might help guide the reader through the logical progression of ideas, making the narrative smoother and more cohesive.
